# Phryxam's PACTF2017 Writeups

So for a while, these writeups were sitting in a password protected zip in a
private repository. Originally because the competition hadn't finished and I
didn't want to give out the answers for free. Anywho, these writeups are
old and unfinished... and rather bad too. But they show the level I was at
at the time, and am hoping my future writeups will look much better, and
that I'll be able to compare them against the old ones.
