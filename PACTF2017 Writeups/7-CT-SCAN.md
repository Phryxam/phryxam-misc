# Problem 7
## CT S(C)AN (30 Points)
```
CHECK THE SAN. MAYBE CT SCANS ARE USEFUL TOO.
```
This problem is easy as long as you recognize that SAN is referring to Subject Alternative Name instead of Storage Area Network.
By looking at the certificate for the website, we can find the flag under "Certificate Subject Alt Name"


The flag is: `pa1cdnp5ocrn977rcqy98ubvkq92o5-flag.pactf.com`
