# Problem 5
## Dinosaur Never-forget System (30 points)
```
The dinosaurs need some way to archive their messages
and news for the future, so they created the Dinosaur
Never-forget System. They wanted the login to be public,
but they also didnâ€™t want it to be too easy to find.
So they hid it in a system more antiquated than the
dinosaurs themselves.

dinosaurneverforgetsystem.tk
```
Based on the title of the problem, you can tell that it is possible that it will involve DNS based on the fact that it is *D*ionsaur *N*ever-forget *S*ystem.
Upon checking whether or not `dinosaurneverforgetsystem.tk` can be accessed in a browser, we find out that it can't be. When we look up the DNS Record, we find
the flag.



The flag is: `dinosaurs_must_stay_informed`
