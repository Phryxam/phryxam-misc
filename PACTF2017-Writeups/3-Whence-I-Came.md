# Problem 3:
## Whence I Came (10 points)

    Open Sourcery
    Look from where I came! The key is somewhere in there… or at least it’d like to be!

It says Open Source and “Look from where I came!”. First guess was to check if there was a github for PACTF. Sure enough, there was. By following the notes, it’s relatively easy to find the flag from there.


The flag is `WELCOME_TO_PACTF_2017`
