# Old AP Stats Project
## Looking back on an old project

This was an old AP Stats problem that our teacher had wanted written up in a
"nice and easy-to-read format". So I chose to use markdown. Where it says
`North Distribution Graph`, it is indeed supposed to say `Normal Distribution
Graph`. Also, those were supposed to be in-line images. As my first real
attempt at using markdown, I think it came out looking pretty nice. I'm going
to leave this unchanged as I am with the PACTF 2017 Writeups, so I can see
my growth in the future.
